## üé® V0 Landing Page Integration

Successfully integrated a v0-generated landing page as the main index page while preserving the 3D workspace functionality.

### Integration Process

**Project Structure Changes:**
- Moved existing 3D viewer from `/` (root) to `/workspace` route
- Replaced root page with v0 landing page design
- Maintained all existing 3D functionality in workspace

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - New landing page with hero, features, CTA, footer sections
- `src/app/workspace/page.tsx` - Moved 3D CAD viewer here
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - **Critical Fix**: Removed `overflow-hidden` and `h-full` classes that prevented scrolling
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added CSS variables and animations for landing page styling
- `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Added from v0 project for UI consistency
- `src/components/brick-building-animation.tsx` - Custom animated component for hero section
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions for CSS class merging

**Dependencies Added:**
```bash
npm install clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority @radix-ui/react-slot tailwindcss-animate
```

**Critical Fixes Applied:**
1. **Scrolling Issue**: Removed `overflow-hidden` from body in layout.tsx that was preventing page scrolling
2. **CSS Variables**: Updated globals.css with proper HSL color values for Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility
3. **Navigation**: Added proper routing between landing page (/) and workspace (/workspace)

**Current Navigation Flow:**
- `/` - Landing page with animated hero section and call-to-action buttons
- `/workspace` - 3D CAD viewer with "Back to Home" navigation

### Landing Page Features

**Hero Section:**
- Animated text with staggered entrance effects
- Brick building animation cycling through 2D ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí 3D phases
- Call-to-action button linking to workspace

**Features Section:**
- Three-column layout explaining the 2D to 3D conversion process
- Clean white background with orange accent colors

**Call-to-Action Section:**
- Orange gradient background
- Secondary CTA button for workspace access

**Footer:**
- Dark theme with navigation links
- Consistent branding and copyright

**Animations:**
- Custom CSS keyframes for slide-stagger effects
- Brick building component with phase transitions
- Hover effects on buttons and links

This integration maintains the existing Phase 1 POC functionality while providing a professional landing experience for users.
